# Overview of the Copilot GPT template

## Build a Copilot GPT from a new API with Azure Functions

With Copilot GPT, you can build a custom version of Copilot that can be used for specific scenarios, such as for specialized knowledge, implementing specific processes, or simply to save time by reusing a set of AI prompts. For example, a grocery shopping Copilot GPT can be used to create a grocery list based on a meal plan that you send to the Copilot GPT. 

## Get started with the template

> **Prerequisites**
>
> To run this app template in your local dev machine, you will need:
>
> - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), supported versions: 18
> - A [Microsoft 365 account for development](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/accounts)
> - [Teams Toolkit Visual Studio Code Extension](https://aka.ms/teams-toolkit) version 5.0.0 and higher or [Teams Toolkit CLI](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-cli)
> - [Copilot for Microsoft 365 license](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/prerequisites#prerequisites)

1. First, select the Teams Toolkit icon on the left in the VS Code toolbar.
2. In the Account section, sign in with your [Microsoft 365 account](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/accounts) if you haven't already.
3. Select `Debug in Copilot (Edge)` or `Debug in Copilot (Chrome)` from the launch configuration dropdown.
4. Send a message to Copilot to find a repair record.
